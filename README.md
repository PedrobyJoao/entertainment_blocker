## Why
I'm too tired to explain why but you might imagine

## Warning: Bad code quality and poor UI
I didn't want to waste too much time doing this but I also needed this working for my daily tasks,
so I just rushed it.

The code organization and UI are quite (aka very) bad but I won't put efforts to improve it now
as I just needed something functional and working as expected.

## TODOs
- Popup on the same tab
- Remove youtube feed
